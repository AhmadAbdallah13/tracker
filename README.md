# Tracker
Simply put this app will show the installed apps and an option to toggle each one, when using a toggled app this app 
will track the usage period and if it exceeds 10 minutes (in one consecutive session) all toggled apps will be blocked for one hour.

In order to work correctly this app requires multiple permissions, when opening the app for the first time it will redirect the user
directly to the appropriate settings permission page multiple times (to grant all permissions) because I am too lazy to implement
a pop up to ask for the permissions
